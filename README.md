Flappy Bird with Enhancements

Overview
This project aims to add unique enhancements to the traditional Flappy Bird game, making it more engaging and challenging. The game is developed using Unity and scripted in C#. While the core mechanics remain the same, where the bird flaps to navigate through pipes, additional features have been introduced to provide a fresh experience.

Features
Flappy Bird Mechanics: The bird flaps to move upwards and falls due to gravity, navigating through pipes.

Rotating Bird: Every time the bird flaps, it rotates 90 degrees.

Egg Shooting: Players can press the 'E' key to shoot eggs. Each game session allows for 5 egg shots.

Pipe Destruction: Eggs destroy pipes upon collision, clearing the bird's path.

Self-Destruction Risk: If an egg is shot while the bird is facing left, it results in the bird hitting itself, ending the game.

Boundary Conditions: The game ends if the bird flies out of the designated boundaries.
